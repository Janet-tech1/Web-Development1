                    <p>Emma's mom, Sarah, was busy setting up their family booth, where they would be setting homemade lemonade and baked goods. She was determined to make this the best SummerFest yet, and she had spent hours perfecting her secret recipe for lemon bars. As she arranged the treats on the table, the sweet aroma wafted through the air, enticing the passersby to come and sample their wares.</p>
